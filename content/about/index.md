## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Vegard SjÃ¥vik

I'm a computer science graduate from [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/) (class of 2025), where I specialized in Artificial Intelligence ðŸ¤–. My academic journey focused on how machines can learn, adapt, and support humansâ€”particularly through building solid training data foundations for robust machine learning models.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a broad skill set across the stackâ€”from frontend and backend development to infrastructure and DevOps. I'm especially passionate about the role data plays in modern software. My focus spans the full data lifecycle: from collection and processing to enabling data-driven decisions and powering advanced AI systems.

These days, I'm exploring how to build **data-intensive applications**â€”scalable, reliable systems that support real-world AI use. Itâ€™s a challenging and rewarding space, and this site is where I document the journey.

## ðŸŽ¸ Outside of Work

When I'm not writing code or thinking about data pipelines, youâ€™ll likely find me:

- Playing guitar (sometimes loud ðŸŽ¶)
- Skiing in the backcountry and chasing powder days ðŸŽ¿
- Reading history or philosophy ðŸ“š
- Soaking up nature, in any season ðŸŒ²

## ðŸ§  Interests

Iâ€™m endlessly curious, and Iâ€™m especially drawn to:

- History & Philosophy â€” exploring ideas and how they shape our world
- Music â€” both creating and listening
- The outdoors â€” the best kind of perspective reset
